\section{Future Work to be Done}
This section highlights the work left to be done in the subsequent interactions.
\subsection{Testing on Real Quantum Hardware}
So far all the results obtained are the outputs of simulations of the quantum circuits on a classical computer. The next phase will deal with actually using an IBM quantum system to execute the circuit. The circuit is quite heavy (17 qubits) and requires significant amount of quantum computing resources to execute. We will figure this out and check the probability distributions from a real quantum computer\cite{qsys}. 
\subsection{Developing a Secure Blockchain Using Entanglement}
We will use the Bell's Measure and the CHSH inequality to develop a secure blockchain\cite{ent}\cite{qkd} (See \ref{appC}).
\subsection{Quantum Hashing}
We will develop some novel hashing algorithms that are purely quantum mechanical and cannot be implemented on a classical computer.
